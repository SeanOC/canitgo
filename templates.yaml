welcome: Welcome to can this go!  Ask me if something can go in your microwave, dishwasher, or oven and I can help you figure it out.  Say microwave, oven, or dishwasher to get started.

oven_start: Does your item have "oven safe" printed on it anywhere?
oven_done_positive: Great! You're good to put your item in the oven.
oven_composition_question: OK, what is the item made of?

microwave_start: Does your item have "microwave safe" printed on it anywhere?
microwave_done_positive: Great! You're good to put your item in the microwave.
microwave_metal_question:  Does your item contain any metal?
microwave_metal_done: Metal doesn't play nice with microwaves.  You should transfer your food to a microwave safe dish before putting it in the microwave.
microwave_plastic_start: Does your item contain any plastic?

dishwasher_start: Does your item have "dishwashwer safe" printed on it anywhere?
dishwasher_done_positive: Great! You're good to put your item in the dishwasher.
